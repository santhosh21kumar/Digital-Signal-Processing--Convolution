# Digital-Signal-Processing--Convolution
## Aim:
                  To perform linear convolution using MAT LAB.
## Software Required:
MAT LAB R2012
## Algorithm:
Step 1: Open mat lab. Write the program.

Step 2: Read the first input sequence.

Step 3: Read the second impulse sequence.

Step 4: Plot the input sequences with x-label and y-label with suitable title. 

Step 5: Perform convolution for both the sequences using conv2() function.
  
Step 6: Plot the sequence with x-label and y-label with suitable title

Step 7: Terminate the program.
